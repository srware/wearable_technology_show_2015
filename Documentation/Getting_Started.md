# Intel Hackfest

## Getting Started

On the day you will be receiving an [IntelÂ® Edison Module](http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html) and breakout board along with a [Grove starter kit plus](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-starter-kit-plus-Intel-IoT-Edition-for-Intel-Galileo-Gen-2-and-Edison-p-1978.html). You will also receive a USB stick with all the files you will require to get started. Where possible I would recommend reading through the steps below and following instructions for installing drivers and your desired IDE to save time on the day.

```
All driver and IDE installers are available on the USB stick supplied if not downloaded prior to the event.
```
* If you are going to be using a Windows machine please install the following drivers for communicating with the Edison.
    - [Intel Edison Drivers](http://downloadmirror.intel.com/24698/eng/IntelEdisonDriverSetup1.2.1.exe)
    - [FTDI Serial Driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/CDM/CDM%20v2.10.00%20WHQL%20Certified.exe)

* You will require a serial client to interact with the Edison operating system. For Linux and Mac systems we would recommend using 'screen'. For Windows you can use [Putty](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe).
* Pick your preferred programming language and install the corresponding IDE by following the instructions for your operating system in the links below.
    - [Arduino](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/install-arduino-ide-on-intel-iot-platforms)
    - [Javascript (Node.js)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/install-the-intel-xdk-iot-edition) [You do not need to install Bonjour, connecting to Edison manually is recommended]
    - [C/C++](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/install-eclipse-ide-on-intel-iot-platforms)
* Please read through the 'Getting Started' guide below which correlates to your operating system to familiarise yourself with the Edison connection process.
    - [Windows](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/getting-started-with-the-intel-edison-board-on-windows)
    - [Mac](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/getting-started-with-the-intel-edison-board-on-mac)
    - [Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/getting-started-with-the-intel-edison-board-on-linux)

```
The Edison you receive on the day will be updated with the latest firmware and will be pre-configured so you can get started as quickly as possible.
```
