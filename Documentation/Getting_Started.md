# Intel Hackfest

## Getting Started

At this point you should have the following:

* IntelÂ® Edison & Grove Kit
* Edison USB stick
* PSU
* Micro-USB cable (there is another in your Grove Kit)

You should also have completed the following:

* If using Windows you should have the Edison drivers installed.
* You should have your favourite serial client installed (e.g. Putty)
* You should have your chosen IDE installed so you can begin development (i.e. XDK, Eclipse, Arduino)

> <strong>If you have not completed any of the above please follow the steps outlined [here](../master/Documentation/Setup.md)</strong>

## Unboxing
Please follow the steps below to assemble and connect your Edison.

## Test Your IDE
You are now ready to begin developing. We would recommend starting with a simple example to make sure your IDE is communicating with your Edison correctly.
* [Eclipse (C/C++](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/getting-started-with-eclipse-on-intel-iot-platforms#launch)
* [XDK (Javascript)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/getting-started-with-intel-xdk-iot-edition-on-intel-iot-platforms#launch)
* [Arduino](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-iot-platforms-blink-led-arduino-ide)
