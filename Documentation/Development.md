# Intel Hackfest

## Development

Here you will find some useful resources to help you during the development phase of the hackfest. There are a number of useful libraries and services you can use to help you achieve your end goal.

## Grove Kit Sensors
Your Grove kits contain a range of sensors and actuators which can be used with your Edison to create a working prototype. For more information about these sensors and code examples please go [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/devkit) and click on the link for the sensors you are interested in using. You can also find useful information at the [Grove Wiki](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Grove). For details on how to correctly connect sensors to the base shield please refer to your 'Grove Starter Kit' booklet which can be found underneath the white plastic sensor tray in your Grove Kit.

## Libraries
The libraries referenced below are all pre-installed and available to use on your Edison.

* [MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) - Low level IO library ([Documentation](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/), [Examples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa/tree/master/examples))
* [UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm) - High level sensor library ([Documentation](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/), [Examples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/tree/master/examples))

## Cloud Analytics
Intel has it's own [IoT Analytics](https://dashboard.us.enableiot.com/ui/auth#/login) cloud service which is free to use for non-commercial use. With this service you can:
* Send data from your Edison to the cloud
* View and chart your data from anywhere on the web
* Create rules to monitor your data 24x7
* Send alerts and trigger events when rules fire
* And much more using the REST API...

The following links contain information on getting setup and using the IoT Analytics service.
